# PickleLeaf

## Inspiration
_Ever tired of scrolling down the facebook group to find the textbook you want?_
_Having trouble finding the cheapest book available on the market?_

These are frustrating problems I encountered in my first year of University, which inspired me to create this platform for everyone to trade books. I made PickleLeaf so that you can **find the book you want instantly and compare prices among different sellers**.

## History
Pickling - _the process of preserving or expanding the lifespan of food_
Leaf - _things that grow on trees, which are made into books_
**PickleLeaf** - _preserving the lifespan of books_
